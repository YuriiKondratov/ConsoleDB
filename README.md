# Task API
This is a simple CRUD Task API - my first Spring Boot project, made as VibeLab (https://vibelab.etu.ru/) introductory exercise.  

Project uses my own implementation of in memory database from `database.java` file.

#### Run
To run the application use `mvnw spring-boot:run`.

#### Docs
After running you can access Open API docs on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.
